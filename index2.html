            <p>DEBATE-Kansas City was conceived in 1998 as part of a national movement to get debate back into urban schools, which was ironically fueled by the collapse of democracy in the former Soviet Union.  When the Iron Curtain fell, the Open Society Institute (OSI) of New York was inspired to fund debate and democracy training in Eastern Europe. American supporters of debate used this moment to highlight the need for debate programs in America’s urban schools. Kansas City was one of several locations to receive a three-year grant from the (OSI) to start an Urban Debate League (UDL). The grant created a partnership between the University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC) and local urban school districts to revive debate. DKC was given staff and resources to deliver debate related-services and manage the competitive league at no cost to seven urban schools. After the grant expired, participating school districts valued the program enough to fund its continuance; member schools began contributing annual service fees to retain DEBATE-Kansas City services. In 2003, to increase financial flexibility, DKC became an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. However, program services were kept at UMKC through a mutually beneficial and highly successful partnership; from 2003 to 2010 DKC grew from 13 to 40 member schools.</p>
            <div id="full-text" style="display: none;">
            <p>DKC was created because in Kansas City, like many other cities across the United States, academic debate had become a thing of the past. Beginning with the loss of city tax revenue in the late 60’s city debate teams began fading away. However, prior to these cuts Kansas City had an incredible debate legacy. Melvin B. Tolson (pictured right), the greatest African American debate coach in our nation’s history, received his early speech training at Lincoln High. His success inspired the film The Great Debaters, where he was played by Denzel Washington. More recently, Joe Miller’s award winning book, Cross-X, detailed the journey and success of the Kansas City Central debate team.</p>
            <p>DKC program graduates have made collegiate debate history. The most famous DKC graduate is Ryan Wash. Wash a graduate of Central High, was part of the first policy debate team to ever win both collegiate debate championships in the same year for Emporia State. In April of 2013 Ryan and his partner Elijah Smith (a fellow UDL graduate from New Jersey) won the 66-year old National Debate Tournament (NDT) after winning the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA) tournament the weekend before. They were the first all black team to win the NDT and first team to ever win both CEDA and the NDT. The history-making tournament victories were document in The Kansas City Star. Only one other team has accomplished this tremendous achievement Devane Murphy and Nicole Nave of Rutgers University and it so happens they were coached by Mr. Ryan Wash. Ryan may be DKC’s greatest debater but most DKC graduates find success in college, life and industry. Our community has so many vibrant and captivating stories it would be impossible to relate them all here.</p>

            <h3>Debate Events</h3>
             <h4>Mock Trial</h4>
               <p>Mock Trial is not only an excellent opportunity to develop public speaking and persuasion skills, it is also a unique opportunity to expose students to the United States Legal system, and the inner workings of the courtroom. Participating in Mock Trial also promotes collaborative working skills and improve critical thinking and analysis.
                By partnering with UMKC’s Mock Trial Team, we at DEBATE-KC hope to encourage students to pursue a career in the legal field, by providing networking opportunities with practicing attorneys, all while engaging in an activity that make college applications stand out! After completing this program, students will not only have exposure to the legal process, but a first-hand look at college life, and a road-map to academic success after high school!</p>
              <h4>Policy Debate</h4>
                <p>Policy debate in high school is a transformative experience that hones critical skills and deepens understanding of current affairs and public policy. Students engage in rigorous research and construct arguments within a structured format, sharpening their analytical and public speaking abilities. This collaborative activity fosters teamwork and leadership as students work together to develop strategies and refine their communication skills. Partnering with mentors at DEBATE-Kansas City provides students with guidance and exposure to career paths in law, public policy, and academia. Policy debate not only prepares students for competitive success but also equips them with confidence, leadership, and the ability to navigate complex issues. It's a pathway to academic success and personal growth, offering a platform for students to explore societal challenges and contribute meaningfully to civic discourse.</p>
              <h4>Student Congress</h4>
              <p>Student Congress in high school immerses students in legislative simulation, mirroring the United States Congress. They research and debate proposed legislation on current issues, mastering parliamentary procedures and persuasive argumentation. This activity fosters critical thinking and civic engagement as students navigate diverse viewpoints and propose solutions to real-world challenges. Collaboration and leadership are central as students negotiate, advocate, and seek consensus. Partnering with mentors from DEBATE-Kansas City, students gain insights into legislative processes and potential careers in law, politics, or public service. Student Congress prepares students for academic success while nurturing informed, active citizenship and a commitment to making positive impacts in their communities.</p>
